		<p>My name is Maria Beane. Originally from the suburbs of New York City, I moved to Austin to attend Texas State in 2010. I completed my Master of Fine Arts in Communication Design in 2014. Currently I am a designer at Findyr, a startup based in New York City. I mostly work on UX/UI and am also in any public facing company web pages.
